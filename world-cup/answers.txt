Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: There is a 0.0% chance of winning for two of the teams when tested with 1000000 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: "Good enough" depends on acceptable accuracy; consider stopping when cost outweighs marginal improvement. 10000 simulations would be enough.
